    <h1>Getting back to HMTLCSS</h1>

    <h2>What did I learn?</h2>
    <p>I still understand the basics quite well, but it's always nice to create a new project from scratch.</p>

    <h2>What problems occured?</h2>
    <p>I forgot how links work, but W3Schools knows best.</p>

    <h2>What mistakes did I make?</h2>
    <p>Misspelling a few tags or forgetting to close them. Also the image didn't load since I forgot to add the folder name.</p>

    <h2>What's unclear?</h2>
    <p>I don't really have an idea of what we're gonna do with this site yet so I'm not sure how much I want to invest in the setup yet since that may be subject to change.</p>

    <h4>Might use <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/">Bootstrap</a> later</h4>

    <h2>Fun image to test</h2>
